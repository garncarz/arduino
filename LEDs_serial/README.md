# LED row controlled via Serial

Based on the 8th project from the Arduino Starter Kit, the schema is the same.

The tilt switch is just a bonus, toggles LEDs to opposite when the board is shaken/tilted. ☺


## Focused keys

Pressing `0`-`5` toggles a corresponding LED.


## All keys (& mouse)

Special keys (arrows, space, enter, backspace, delete, pg up/down, home, end) animate,
other ones toggle a LED based on a key code.

Mouse also animates/toggles. ☺


## Audio

Binds to a sound card's input and shows the volume level.
Tries to operate within reasonable range for past few seconds.
